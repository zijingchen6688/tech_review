Please enter your topics here by Week 8 (Oct 18): https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rYlXm-46abhU4Lg7K2zrDE6VSl2uH_tNql1S7fd1UIM/edit?usp=sharing. You may choose a topic already chosed by other students (e.g. Survey of text mining toolkits) but please make sure that your review covers something novel that is not available online or in other students' submissions. The "description" column in the sign up sheet should help identify whether your review will be unique or not. So, please read the desciptions of other students who've chosen a similar topic as you. You should also provide sufficient details in your description to help others decide.


Some sample topics have been provided here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yeKm8hJbyRGhiUDvZv9-S3Zzu5hDtET-O6Yeci-VPOs/edit?usp=sharing. You are free to use them or come up with your own topics!
